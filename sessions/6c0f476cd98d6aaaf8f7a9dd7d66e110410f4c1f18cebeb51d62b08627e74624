Prospects sense it. Conversion drops again.\n\nThis is the worst case scenario - so it's obviously preferable to be at 100% with inefficiency then barely scraping by.\n\nBUT…\n\n70% Scheduled = Maximum Output\n\nThis is just below the comfort point for most salespeople.\n\nIt forces them to work their pipeline. They have time for consultations and follow-up meetings. But they're not so empty they get desperate.\n\nThis is where conversion peaks.\n\nOr at least, this is where I’ve seen the sweet spot across our teams.\n\nWhat To Do:\n\nIf you control your sales team's calendars and you're consistently at 80%+ utilization, you probably need more salespeople. Even before they tell you they're swamped.\n\nI'm not saying turn off a good marketing campaign.\n\nI'm saying if your team is constantly maxed out, you're leaving money on the table by not having more capacity.\n\nHypothetical Math:\n\n5 reps at 100% utilization closing 20% = 100 deals\n\n7 reps at 70% utilization closing 30% = 147 deals\n\nThe difference really can be dramatic.\n\nMore reps at lower utilization can close more deals than fewer reps at full capacity.\n\nThe conversion rate difference makes up for the \"inefficiency.\"\n\nSo don't always assume everyone needs to be maxed out to squeeze the most out. Because it's almost always the opposite.\n\nAs promised, value in under a minute.\n\nWant help optimizing your sales team's capacity and conversion?\n\nWe just opened spots for our next Scaling Workshop in Vegas.\n\nLast month's attendees averaged $2.9M in revenue - we turn away 65% of applicants to keep the room quality high.\n\nSchedule a call here.

Blow the intro, blow the sale.\n\nMozi Minute: How To Open A Sales Call\n\nThe intro is the first 30-60 seconds of every call. You can blow a 30-minute call in 30 seconds.\n\nHere's how to not do that.\n\nThe Big Four (Required By Law):\n\nEvery call must have:\n\n- Your name\n- Your company name\n- That the call is recorded\n- The reason you're calling\n\nSome salesmen say this \"sounds like a sales call.\" They're idiots.\n\nYou know what else it sounds like? A legitimate business.\n\nEvery large publicly traded company does this and they make billions. Follow the law. It works fine.\n\nThen State The Agenda:\n\n\"You opted in for [lead magnet]. During this call we'll [thing 1, thing 2, thing 3], and at the end we'll see if it makes sense to move forward. If not - no sweat.\"\n\nFull Intro Example:\n\n\"[Name]? Hey it's [Rep] from Acquisition.com calling about [Product] on a recorded line - how's it going?\"\n\n[Wait for response]\n\n\"Great. Excited for our call. We only have 20 minutes though. Cool if we jump in?\"\n\n[Wait for response]\n\n\"Let's do it. We'll spend a couple minutes diving through your metrics to make sure you're a fit. And if so, happy to walk you through [Product]. If things make sense we can get you all set up. Sound good?\"\n\nPro Tip: Note how smooth the recorded line mention is. It’s super tight. No one will care. For real. Don't worry about it.\n\nJust say it the way it’s scripted and you’ll be fine.\n\nPro Tip #2: Most people appreciate getting right to it - especially B2B. Get the big 4 out of the way, and get into it.\n\nMany people waste time that does not increase the likelihood of closing.\n\nWhat The Intro Is NOT:\n\n- Not small talk: \"How's the weather?\"\n- Not a pitch: \"Want a vacuum? Ours really suck!\"\n- Not a place to lie, skip parts, or talk fast\n\nWhat The Intro IS:\n\nThe minimum required questions, with the minimum required words, delivered in the proper tone. That's it. Get through it fast so you have time for discovery and closing.\n\nAs promised, value in under a minute.\n\nWant to train your sales team on intros that don't kill deals?\n\nWe just opened spots for our next Scaling Workshop in Vegas.\n\nLast month's attendees averaged $2.9M in revenue - we turn away 65% of applicants to keep the room quality high.\n\nCheck if you qualify\n( )\n\nTalk soon,\n\n- Alex\n\nPS - How my Thursday is going...

Be tidy, mindful about your noise levels, and take any item you bring along with you when your ride ends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Ride on time by being on time\n\n Double checking your pickup and dropoff locations makes meeting your driver within the free waiting time window easy.\n\n And if you don’t make it and need more time, your ride will still be there. You’ll only be charged a small fee for the longer wait.\n\n\n\n\n Order a ride\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What to do if plans change\n\n Cancelling your ride within 2 minutes of booking is free. After that, you’ll get a cancellation charge based on the time your driver spent making their way to you.\n\n If your driver cancels, we'll immediately refund your authorisation fee. Luckily 98% of our driver partners arrive on time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Rate your trips and keep an eye on your rating\n\n Ratings matters. Positive ones support driver earnings, and negative ones help Bolt improve ride quality for everyone.\n\n But remember, drivers will also rate you.

If you want, I can slide you up.\"\n\nThat's it. One sentence.\n\nBut it increases show rates and sales in SIX different ways:\n\n- Same-Day Show Rates Are Higher\n\nSame-day appointments show and close at much higher rates than next-day and beyond. Strike while they're hot.\n\n- Fewer Blank Spaces\n\nSales reps have higher utilization. You can sell more stuff with fewer people.\n\nMeaning, you can attract higher level talent because you can pay them better. Virtuous cycle.\n\n- Close Hot Leads Immediately\n\nIf someone books and they're ready to buy, you can just close them right there.\n\nYou don't even need to slot them until later if they’re ready.\n\nBut you wouldn’t know if you didn't call to pull up the appt to begin with.\n\n- Opens Future Slots\n\nWhen you pull someone forward, their original slot opens up for someone else to book.\n\nAnd availability is the #1 predictor of throughput on a scheduling funnel.\n\nSo more blank space means more scheduled appts.\n\n- Disqualify Faster\n\nWhen you call to pull them forward, you can DQ people who aren't serious.\n\nThis keeps your calendar clean and availability high for real buyers.\n\n- Sales Team Momentum\n\nThe team will close better having a more packed calendar and can get into a flow.\n\nIf you have too few calls on the calendar, the guys have a harder time getting into the zone.\n\nThis is just a personal observation there is a “sweet spot” on sales efficiency.\n\nWhy This Works:\n\nProspects are most motivated the moment they book.\n\nEvery hour that passes, motivation drops.\n\nPull them forward while they're hot & close them.\n\nImplementation:\n\nSet up a simple rule:\n\nEvery time someone books, your team calls them within 5 minutes.\n\nQualify them. Offer to slide them up.\n\nBest case: you get all the benefits above.\n\nWorst case: you still increase show and close rates and make sure they're qualified.\n\nWin-win.\n\nAs promised, value in under a minute.\n\nWant more tactics like this to increase show and close rates?\n\nThis is the last chance to grab a spot at one of our Scaling Workshops before the end of the year.\n\nPlus if you do it right now… it's a tax write off for 2025.\n\nTap below to see if it's a good fit:\n\nView Available Dates\n( )\n\nPull them forward, close them faster,\n\n- Alex\n\nPS - New year, new me ( )\n\nAcquisitionLogoSambucus ( )\n\nAcquisition, LLC, 7710 North FM 620 Rd Building 13C, Suite 100,\n\nAustin, Texas, 78726, United States\n\nUnsubscribe ( ) Manage Preferences ( )\n\nThis message, including any hypothetical scenarios described, is provided for informational and illustrative purposes only and does not constitute professional advice.
