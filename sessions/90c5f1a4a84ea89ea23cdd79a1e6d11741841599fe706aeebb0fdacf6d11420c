It seems like there are no deals available in your account at the moment. The response indicates that there are no records found, with a total of 0 deals.\n\nLet's try to explore this further. Could you please tell me a bit more about what you're looking for in your deals? Are you looking for deals that are in a specific stage, or perhaps deals that are associated with a particular account or contact? This will help me provide you with more relevant information and assistance.\n\nIn the meantime, I can offer some suggestions on how to get started with creating or managing deals in your Salesforce account. Would you like some guidance on that?"}}}
