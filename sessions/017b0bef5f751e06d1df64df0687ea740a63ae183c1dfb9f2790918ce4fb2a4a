Let me try to help you understand what might have happened. \n\nSince the response says \"source: cache\", it's possible that the results are being fetched from a cached source, which might not have the most up-to-date information. Additionally, the \"total\" count is 0, which suggests that there are no deals available in the system that match the query.\n\nCan you tell me a bit more about what you're trying to achieve with these deals? Are you looking to track progress, identify potential opportunities, or something else? This might help me provide a more tailored solution for you. \n\nAlso, would you like me to try refetching the deals or exploring other options to get the information you need?"}}}
