And when should you use it?\n\n“Hello” is a simple and widely understood way to greet someone and start a conversation. You can say it when you answer the phone, meet someone new or see a friend. It’s used in almost every English-speaking country and works in most situations. [...] In English-speaking cultures, saying “hello” is more than just a word – it’s a polite and friendly way to show respect or warmth. How you say it can change depending on who you’re talking to and where you are.\n\nFor example, saying “hello” to a friend might sound relaxed and casual. But if you’re greeting someone in a job interview, you’ll want to sound more formal and respectful. (More on that below.) [...] No matter where you are on your language learning journey, you’ve probably come across the word “hello.” After all, it’s one the most common greetings in the world. And it’s no surprise why: it’s short, simple and easy to say.\n\nBut greetings in English aren’t one-size-fits-all. How you say hello can depend on the time of day, your relationship to the person you’re greeting, or even whether you’re chatting online vs. in person.\nScore: 0.7761\n\nTitle: HELLO Definition & Meaning\nURL: https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hello\nContent: hel·​lo  hə-ˈlō\")\n\nhe-\n\nplural hellos\n\nSynonyms of hello\n\n: an expression or gesture of greeting  \n—used interjectionally in greeting, in answering the telephone, or to express surprise\n\nhello there\n\nwaved hello\n\n## Synonyms of hello\n\nRelevance\n\n salute\n salutation\n greeting\n welcome\n\nSee All Synonyms & Antonyms in Thesaurus\n\n## Examples of hello in a Sentence\n\nThey welcomed us with a warm hello.     we said our hellos and got right down to business\n\nRecent Examples on the Web [...] Don't answer the phone with 'ahoy'\n\n## Cite this Entry\n\n“Hello.” Merriam-Webster.com Dictionary, Merriam-Webster,  Accessed 2 Jan. 2026.\n\nCopy Citation\n\n## Share\n\n## Kids Definition\n\nhello\n\nnoun\n\nhel·​lo  hə-ˈlō\")\n\nhe-\n\nplural hellos\n\n: an expression or gesture of greeting  \n—used in greeting, in answering the telephone, or to express surprise\n\n## More from Merriam-Webster on hello\n\nNglish: Translation of hello for Spanish Speakers\n\nLast Updated:  - Updated example sentences [...] event, bidding a quick hello to Ronson and earning some stares from the upstate locals, confused by our presence—and matching outfits.   —Hannah Jackson, Vogue, 30 Oct. 2025    See All Example Sentences for hello\nScore: 0.7743\n\nTitle: What is the definition of “hello”?\nURL: https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-definition-of-hello\nContent: “Hello” is an alteration of hallo, hollo, which came from Old High German “hala, hola”, emphatic imperative of “halon, holon. to fetch”, used especially in hailing a ferryman.\n\nThomas Edison put “hello” into common usage.

It also connects the development of hello to the influence of an earlier form, holla, whose origin is in the French holà (roughly, 'whoa there!', from French là 'there'). As in addition to hello, halloo, hallo, hollo, hullo and (rarely) hillo also exist as variants or related words, [...] Hello (often \"hi\" in modern English for frequent use) is a salutation or greeting in the English language. It is first attested in writing from 1826.\n\n## Early uses [...] According to the American Heritage Dictionary, hallo is a modification of the obsolete holla (stop!), perhaps from Old French hola (ho, ho! + la, there, from Latin illac, that way).\n\n### \"Hello, World\" computer program\n\nMain article: \"Hello, World!\" program\nScore: 0.8574\n\nTitle: Hello - Definition, Meaning & Synonyms\nURL: https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/hello\nContent: SKIP TO CONTENT\n\nIPA guide\n\nOther forms: hellos\n\nHello! Hi! How are you doing? Hello is a salutation or greeting commonly used to begin conversations or telephone calls. [...] Hello has been used as an English greeting since the 19th century. Most agree that it is related to the older French exclamation “Holà” — which means essentially “Ho there!” — like you might say to a horse to tell it to stop. Nowadays it’s still used to get someone’s attention but instead of stopping you’re starting something — usually a chat.
