Email tracking helps you understand which leads are engaged when they open your message multiple times or if a client received the information you sent them.\n\nInstead of looking through your Gmail app email by email to see which ones have been read, take meaningful action in the \"Recently Viewed\" email folder and in your pipeline columns. [...] Instead of looking at email tracking data for every single one of your emails, you can see all recently viewed emails related to a particular project or process, like Sales or Hiring.\n\nFor example, if you're hiring for a new role at your company, you'll be able to see when your leads and candidates last opened your emails. You don't have to sift through all of your sent mail, which might include emails you sent to co-workers and other unrelated messages.\nScore: 0.9907\n\nTitle: My Inbox Email List doesn't start by showing the latest emails\nURL: https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1447723\nContent: My Thunderbird Inbox is set up to order the emails so the oldest emails are at the top of the list, and the part of the list that is showing in the window on the screen is the bottom of the list, therefore the most recent emails.
